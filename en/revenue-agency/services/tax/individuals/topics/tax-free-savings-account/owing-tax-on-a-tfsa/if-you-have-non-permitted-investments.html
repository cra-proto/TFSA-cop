                            <p>A prohibited investment is an investment that a TFSA trust acquires that is closely connected to the TFSA holder. For example, this can happen if a TFSA holder has a significant interest in a company (10% or more ownership). </p>
                              <p>To review the definition of a prohibited investment, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-3-property-investments-savings-plans/series-3-property-investments-savings-plan-folio-10-registered-plans-individuals/income-tax-folio-s3-f10-c2-prohibited-investments-rrsps-rrifs-tfsas.html#toc3">Prohibited Investments – RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs, FHSAs and TFSAs (Income Tax Folio  S3-F10-C2).</a></p>


                            <h3>Tax you may owe on a prohibited investment</h3>
                            <p>If at any time in the calendar year your investment is or  becomes prohibited, it will be <strong>taxable at 50%</strong>  of the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the investment.</p>
                              <p>To calculate the amount you owe, complete and submit a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">TFSA Return (RC243)</a>, including &ldquo;Part D – Tax on prohibited investments&rdquo;.</p>
                       <p>If a prohibited investment stops being prohibited, the trust is considered to have disposed of the prohibited  investment and immediately re-acquired it as a permitted investment at FMV.</p>
                              <p>If the prohibited investment earns any income or has capital gains, you will also be liable for the <strong>100% advantage tax</strong>.</p>

                            <p>If an investment is both prohibited and non-qualified,  the CRA will consider it a prohibited investment only.<br>
                              For information:  <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#nonqual">What is a non-qualified investment</a></p>

                              <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  prohibited investment if the investment was disposed of or stopped being  prohibited <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year it  was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).</p>

                            <summary>Details on requesting a refund of the tax on a prohibited investment</summary>
                            <p>The CRA will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  prohibited.</p>
                              <p>If the tax on the prohibited investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the <strong>same calendar year</strong>, then you do not have to pay the tax. However, you must still file a TFSA Return. </p>

                            <h4>How  to request a refund</h4>
                              <p>To request a refund of the 50% tax on a prohibited  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243).</p>
                              <p>Be sure to attach documents that detail the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment</li>
                              <li>Number of shares or units</li>
                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became prohibited</li>
                              <li>Date the investment was disposed of or stopped being prohibited</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the prohibited investment <strong>in the same year</strong> you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in  Section 2 of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>
                            <p>The refund only applies to the 50% tax on prohibited  investments, not the 100% tax on an advantage.</p>
                              

<p>Submit your refund request using <strong>one</strong> of the  following methods:</p>

                            <h4>TFSA issuers must inform holders </h4>
                            <p>TFSA issuers must take care to minimize the possibility that a TFSA trust holds non-qualified investments. They must notify you before March of the following year if the TFSA acquired or disposed of a non-qualified  investment, or if an investment became or stopped being non-qualified.</p>
                      <p> Any gains made through a non-qualified TFSA investment are taxable to the trustee using a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3RET)</a>. However, the trustee may recoup these amounts from the TFSA, reducing its value.  </p>
                    

                            <h3 id="toc22">Refund of non-qualified investment tax</h3>
                            <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  non-qualified investment if the investment was disposed of or stopped being  non-qualified <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year  it was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).  </p>

                              <summary>Details on requesting a refund of the tax on a non-qualified investment</summary>
                              <p>The CRA will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  non-qualified.</p>
                              <p>If the tax  on the non-qualified investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the same calendar year, then you don't have to pay the tax. However, you must still file a TFSA Return.</p>


                              <h4>How  to request a refund</h4>
                              <p>To request a refund of the 50% tax on a non-qualified  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243).</p>
                          <p>Be sure to attach documents that detail the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment </li>

                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became non-qualified  </li>
                              <li>Date the investment was disposed  of or became qualified  </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the non-qualified investment in the  same year you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in Section 2  of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>

                            <p>TFSA holders must avoid investments or transactions that are structured in way to artificially shift value into or out of the TFSA or result in certain advantages.</p>
					  <p>An advantage can be a benefit or a debt that is conditional on the existence of the TFSA, subject  to certain exceptions for normal investment activities and conventional  incentive programs.</p>

                              <p> An  advantage can include any benefit that is an increase in the total <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the property of the TFSA that is reasonably attributable to any  one of the following:</p>

                              <li>A transaction or event (or series)  that would not have occurred in a normal commercial or investment context  between arm&rsquo;s length parties acting prudently, knowledgeably, and willingly,  and one of the main purposes of which is to benefit from the tax-exempt status  of the TFSA </li>
                              <li>A payment received in substitution  for a payment for services rendered by the holder (or non-arm&rsquo;s length person)  or for a return on investment on non-registered property </li>
                              <li>A swap transaction </li>
                              <li>Specified non-qualified investment  income that has not been paid from the TFSA within 90 days of the holder  receiving a notice from CRA requiring removal </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>An advantage also includes any benefit that is income or  a capital gain that is reasonably attributable to one of the following: </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>A prohibited investment </li>
