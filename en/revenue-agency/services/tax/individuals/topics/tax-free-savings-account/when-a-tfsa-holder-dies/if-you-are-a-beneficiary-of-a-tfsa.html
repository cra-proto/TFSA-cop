                      <p>However, any TFSA earnings made after the date of death and before the estate is settled are taxable. The tax implications depend on the type of TFSA.</p>

                            <p>If there is no  successor holder, the deposit or annuity contract stops existing when the  holder of the TFSA dies.</p>
                            <p>The deceased holder is considered to have disposed of their TFSA  immediately before the time of death for an amount equal to the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of all the property held in the TFSA at that time. The  deposit or annuity contract becomes a separate contract and is no longer considered  to be a TFSA.</p>
                              <p>All earnings that grow after the deceased holder&rsquo;s death are  taxable to the beneficiary.<br>
                              <p>Depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or  annuity contract, the normal rules apply for reporting income or gains earned after  the date of death, such as reporting any interest earned on a T5 Statement of  Investment Income.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Taxes on an arrangement in trust TFSA </h3>
                            <p>If there is no successor holder, a TFSA that is an  arrangement in trust continues to exist and stays non-taxable until the end of  the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#exemptperiod">exempt period<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>. However, income earned during the exempt period and  paid to beneficiaries is taxable income.</p>
                           
                            <p>This means that any amount up to the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the deceased holder&rsquo;s TFSA on the date of death can be  paid to beneficiaries without them having to report it as income. But any  amount paid to beneficiaries that is more than the FMV on the date of death is taxable and beneficiaries must report this as income. These payments are in box 134 in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income</a>.</p>
                            <p>The trust must distribute both the  taxable and non-taxable amounts during the exempt period. The trustee will indicate the part of each  payment that is non-taxable, with the rest being taxable.</p>     
                          <details>
                            <summary>If the trust exists after the exempt period</summary>
                            <p>If the trust continues to exist after the end of the exempt  period (for example, if not all amounts from the deceased&rsquo;s TFSA have been paid  to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward.</p>
                         
                            <p>After the exempt period ends, the trust becomes a taxable  inter-vivos trust (a living trust) with a tax year that begins January 1 of the  following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and immediately reacquired its property for its FMV at the end of the exempt period.</p>
                            
                            <p>The trust will have to file a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3RET)</a> every tax year. It will  also have to prepare a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">T3 Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations</a> in that year or later  years for any distribution of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>

                            <p>If you are a non-resident beneficiary, including non-resident  survivor, you must report payment amounts you receive from the trust during the exempt period that are above the fair market value (FMV) of the TFSA. These payments are subject to non-resident withholding tax.</p>
