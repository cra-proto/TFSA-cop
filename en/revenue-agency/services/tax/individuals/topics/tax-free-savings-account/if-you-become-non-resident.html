<p>Residency status can only be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, to be considered a resident you must have significant residential ties to Canada. This may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A home in Canada </li>
    <li>A spouse or common-law partner in Canada </li>
	<li>Dependants in Canada </li>
</ul>
<p>Other secondary residential ties may also be considered collectively:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal property in Canada </li>
	<li>Social or economic ties with Canada </li>
	<li>Landed immigrant status </li>
	<li>Hospitalization and medical insurance coverage from a province or territory of Canada </li>
	<li>A driver's license or vehicle registered in a province or territory in Canada</li>
	<li>A Canadian passport </li>

<h2 id="toc2">Tax implications for non-resident TFSA holders</h2>

<h3>You may keep your TFSA</h3>

<p>If you become a non-resident, you are allowed to keep your existing TFSA. Any income you earn in your account, such as interest, dividends, or capital gains will not be taxed in Canada.</p>
							
<p>However, income you earn through your TFSA may be taxed in your country of residence. Verify the tax obligations in your country of residence. </p>


<h3>You may withdraw from your TFSA </h3>

<p>As a non-resident, you may withdraw funds from your TFSA without being taxed in Canada. However, you cannot re-contribute any amounts tax-free until you become a resident again.</p>

                            <p>TFSA withdrawals may be taxed in your country of residence. Verify the tax obligations in your country of residence. </p>

<h3>You cannot contribute to your TFSA tax-free </h3>

<p>Only residents of Canada may contribute to their TFSA tax-free. You can make tax-free contributions to your TFSA up to the date that you become a non-resident. But after that, any contribution to your TFSA is a <strong>taxable</strong> non-resident contribution.</p>
                            
<p>You will <strong>not</strong> accumulate any new available contribution room for any year in which you are a non-resident for the entire year. However, if you are a resident for part of the year, you will receive the annual dollar limit as contribution room that year.  </p>

<details>
<summary>How non-resident contributions are taxed </summary> 

<p>Any non-resident contribution you make, except for a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution, is subject to a <strong>1% tax</strong> for each month the contribution remains in the account. This tax continues to apply until you withdraw the non-resident contribution or you become a resident of Canada again. </p>

<p>You will receive a TFSA notice of assessment (NOA) for any non-resident contribution you make. </p>

<p>If a non-resident contribution also exceeds your TFSA contribution room, you may be subject to an additional 1% monthly tax on the excess amount. </p>

</details>
                            
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-resident-contributions.html">If you are taxed on non-resident contributions </a></p>

<h2 id="toc3">If you are a non-resident beneficiary of a TFSA</h2>

<p>If you are a non-resident and are named as a beneficiary to a TFSA when the holder dies, there may be tax implications in Canada. Earnings may also be taxable in your country of residence. We recommend you check the tax rules there.    </p>

<p>There are two types of TFSA beneficiaries:  </p>

 <dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
      <dt>Successor holder</dt>
      <dd>The <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#survivor">survivor<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> (spouse or common-law partner) of the deceased who is <strong>named as the new TFSA holder</strong> in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder</dd>
      <dt>Designated beneficiary</dt>
      <dd>A survivor (spouse or common-law partner) not named as successor holder, a family member or other person or organization that is <strong>named as a TFSA beneficiary</strong> in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 id="nonressh">Non-resident successor holder </h3>

<p>Non-resident successor holders who do not have a Social Insurance Number (SIN) should apply for an Individual Tax Number (ITN). </p>

<p>To apply for an ITN: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">Application for a CRA Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents (Form T1261)</a>.</p>

<p>Non-resident successor holders cannot make contributions to the TFSA while they are non-resident. However, they may withdraw funds at any time.  </p>

<p>For more information on successor holders and possible tax implications: <a href="https://cra-proto.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/when-a-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-successor-holder-of-a-tfsa.html">If you are a successor holder</a> </p>

  

<h3>Non-resident designated beneficiary </h3>

<p>A non-resident designated beneficiary of a TFSA may receive a payment in cash or in-kind, depending on the type of TFSA, based on the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the TFSA on the date of death. This amount is not taxable in Canada. </p>

<p>However, any amounts paid during the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#exemptperiod">exempt period<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> that are <strong>above</strong> the FMV at the time of death are subject to non-resident withholding tax.  </p>

<p>You must report these amounts to the CRA by completing a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html">Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada (Form NR4)</a>.</p>
